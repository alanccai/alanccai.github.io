#### Hello! I am a PhD student in the Watershed Sciences program at Colorado State University - Fort Collins. I am interested in the conservation and restoration of aquatic ecosystems. I am a member of the Landscape Modeling research group of Dr. Jessica O'Connell, and I study tidal marsh dynamics and resilience focusing on sites on Sapelo Island, Georgia. Previously, I worked on wet meadow restoration monitoring in California, and researched the ecological management of Western U.S. rivers. I am excited to develop new insights about tidal marsh carbon cycling, flooding dynamics, and phenology. Additionally, I was the Graduate Student member on the UCOWR (Universities Council on Water Resources) Board of Directors from 2023-2024.
